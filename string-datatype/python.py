# example:-1

str1 = "anil"
str2 = "how are you"
result = str1 + " " + str2
print (result)

# example:-2

name = "anil"
age = 28
result = name + " is " + str(age) + " years old! "
print (result)

#ðŸ”¹ Note: You must convert numbers to strings using str(age) before concatenation.

# example:-3

name = "Ashwini"
age = 25
result = f"{name} age is {age} old!"
print (result)

# example:-4

num1 = 32
num2 = 33
sum = f"sum of {num1} and {num2} is {num1 + num2}"
print(sum)

# ðŸš€ No need to use + or str() for type conversion!
# The variable age (integer) is automatically converted to a string.
